# Electronics Task 1 â€“ Controlling 3 LEDs with 3 Push Buttons using Arduino

This project demonstrates a basic Arduino circuit in which three push buttons are used to control three LEDs. Each button turns its corresponding LED on or off.

## ðŸ§  Objective
Create a simple electronic circuit using Arduino where pressing a button controls an LED.

## ðŸ›  Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- 3 LEDs (Red, Green, Yellow)
- 3 Push buttons
- Resistors (for LEDs and pull-downs)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## ðŸ”Œ Description
Each button is connected to a digital input pin with a pull-down resistor to ground. Each LED is connected to a digital output pin through a current-limiting resistor. When a button is pressed, it activates the corresponding LED.

## ðŸ“· Circuit Diagram
The circuit was designed and simulated using Tinkercad.

## ðŸ’¡ Summary
This task is part of an introductory electronics module, focusing on using Arduino to read digital inputs (buttons) and control outputs (LEDs).
